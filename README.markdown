What is this Linkinator?
========================

It's a simple link-sharing webapp for closed groups of people. The idea is that there are some links, ideas, status messages and so on that you need to share with your colleagues, but not with the whole world. 'To: All' email is not the place for this kind of sharing, because as your group grows, these emails become more and more frequent and eventually distract you from the important stuff in your inbox. So, instead of sending an email to 'All', send it to your instance of Linkinator or use the JavaScript 'Linkinate' button, and have everyone's shared links, status updates and so on in one place.

Ugh. I should rewrite this when I have a clue.
